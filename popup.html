            <p class="scary-image-note"><br><br>Hi, my name is Henry, and I am currently a third-year Media & Art student at UNSW. I am a struggling writer and YouTuber. My favorite story types are hero adventures, fantasy, especially those involving tragedy and trauma. I have always believed these genres are much more interesting than comedy, hopeful, or safe genres. My dream is to write my own novel and direct a film based on it, and hopefully see it spread around the world. If I can't achieve this before I turn 30, I may choose to become a freelancer handling PR and advertising work, splitting my time between being a YouTuber and a writer. Life is still long, so be kind to others and to yourself.<br><br>
