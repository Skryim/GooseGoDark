            <p class="scary-image-note"><center><b>(WEEK1 Writing Exericise) "Dark is not Dark"</b><br><br> I will never forget that day; it remains a black mark on my career. When I slowly pushed open the wooden door with the broken lock, I saw a pair of bloodless feet dangling in the air, her neck snapped at an unnatural angle lead to two eyes were looking down at me. I can't put into words the meaning of those eyes. It was as if all the dark emotions of the world had been crammed into his gaze.

I stood there, motionless. One month ago, her daughter are found raped and murdered in a sewer, and the criminal was still at large. As a police officer, I have not only failed to bring the criminal to justice, but also failed to provide her with the care and support she needed, which may have prevented such a tragedy.

Ah, yes, anyone who sees the woman—once beautiful, with a bright future ahead of her—reduced to a lifeless corpse, that dignity stripped away, exuding a powerful stench, will not able to accept it. Not to mention being a mother.

But why I felt an inexplicable sense of relief and laughter now, and I couldn't stop. Why? Because I was there when the crime was committed. No, to be precise, I was one of the accomplices.

            <p class="scary-image-note"><b>(Assessment 1)</b><br><br>In the photo essay, the pronouns he, him, and his all symbolize loneliness. Simply put, this is the speaker’s response to the loneliness that has tormented him for many years, conveyed in the form of a suicide note. The essay uses trauma as its central theme, attempting to evoke a shared sense of loneliness with the audience. Instead of inspiring the audience, the intention is to highlight how overwhelming loneliness can become, in hopes that people will avoid it as much as possible.<br><br>

The photo essay was edited using Wondershare Filmora—primarily because it offers a wide range of royalty-free music, and I’ve been a long-time member. For the audio, the voice-over was recorded with a RODE Podcaster Microphone. There were challenges during the recording process, such as ensuring that my tone and personality were engaging while still conveying the depressive mood I wanted to express. I practiced extensively and sought feedback from a local friend before achieving a result that was at least satisfactory. Additionally, I recorded sound effects, such as the sound of waves, at Bondi Junction Beach, while other sound effects were sourced online.<br><br>

The biggest challenge I faced was the visual presentation, particularly the photos. Since I only got my first phone in high school and I’m not someone who enjoys taking photos, I didn’t have many existing images to use. As a result, I had to visit several places to take new photos that captured my feelings of loneliness during that time, simulating the experiences I had when I was still in China. This process would have been much easier if I considered photography a hobby. However, I believe I effectively developed a strong structure and narrative. I’m proud of the editing work, where nearly every photo transition and color effect was intentionally designed—like the heartbeat, the closing eye, and the motion blur and shaking effects.<br><br>

Ironically, I am a lonely person, so much of this reflects my personal experience, though it is slightly exaggerated in the still image video. I rarely feel happy, largely because of 'him,' which represents my struggle with the inability to attract or maintain friendships. Although I have one or two close friends whom I consider my best, it still feels insufficient compared to what is typically considered 'normal.'<br><br>

I believe this cannot change because this period of my life (school years), often regarded as "the most valuable and free," is nearing its end. As a result, this photo essay also aims to express my concerns about the future. Despite this, I find some comfort in generating ideas from a dark mindset. It makes me feel that I possess at least some sense of uniqueness, and I believe that if I can find happiness at this stage, it might offer solace to others who are also struggling. In a way, this is what trauma can do.

            <p class="scary-image-note"><b>(WEEK2 Writing Exericise)</b><br><br>Not long after I arrived in Sydney, the COVID-19 lockdown unfortunately came into effect. With dining options limited, I quickly developed the habit of ordering fast food daily to manage my meals. This routine went on for a full year, during which I noticed my expenses piling up and my skin health worsening. It wasn’t until the lockdown eased that a friend invited me over to his house for a meal. We decided to cook together, and that night became the first celebratory dinner I prepared and shared with friends since the pandemic began.

Before this, I was never someone who enjoyed cooking or even eating with others. But that meal changed my perspective—maybe it was the food, or perhaps it was my friend’s humor that made the experience so enjoyable. From that day on, I started cooking at home more often, about every three to five days. Gradually, I began to find joy in the process of buying groceries, preparing meals, and even cleaning up afterward. Cooking became one of the few healthy habits in my routine.

Now, whenever I’m tempted to order fast food, I look at this photo and remember how rewarding it felt to enjoy something I’d made myself.

            <p class="scary-image-note"><b>(Week3 shooting excercise)</b><br><br>One day, Linda was waiting for her friend to finish class so they could head home together. As she scrolled through her phone, a sudden shutter sound broke the quiet. She looked up, startled, and noticed something odd—a shadow shifting behind a nearby door.

A chill ran down her spine as she spotted a figure partially obscured in the doorway. Panic rising, she turned and bolted up the stairs, her heart racing as though she were running a 100-meter sprint. But as she sprinted, she realized the figure had started to move too, chasing her like a shadow she couldn’t shake.

She raced up to the second-floor landing, breathless, and froze. Becuase he was already there, standing directly in front of her—a dark silhouette blocking her escape. Her heart pounded as he lifted the camera, finger poised over the shutter.

In that single click, her nightmare was captured.</p>

To do this, we recreated a scene from <i>The Dark Knight</i>, as the setup was somewhat similar to our adaptation. We tested both soft and hard lighting, using a key light with a small amount of fill light to create a low-key atmosphere, aiming to capture the contrast between the brightest and darkest areas. Please disregard any camera shake, as the tripod was not functioning at the time.</p>

Using Adobe Premiere, I challenged myself to adjust the color grading and lighting of the fine cut within 10 minutes. The goal of this exercise was to ensure that, if we need to shoot a clip later, we can quickly use editing to verify whether the camera settings — such as exposure, lighting, and color balance — are optimal.
